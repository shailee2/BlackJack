# Blackjack Game

Welcome to **Blackjack**, a Python-based console game where you can play against the house!

This project implements a simplified version of Blackjack, letting a player place bets, draw cards, and try to beat the house by getting as close as possible to 21 without busting.

## Project Structure
- `deck.py` Deck and Card classes
- `player.py` Player and House classes
- `game.py` Game logic (start_game function)
- `main.py` Entry point to run the game
- `README.md` Project description

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**<br>
   ```
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/shailee2/BlackJack.git

- `player.py`	Defines player and house behavior and hand logic
- `game.py`	Runs a full game loop and manages the round flow
- `main.py`	Simple entry point to launch the game

## Future Improvements
